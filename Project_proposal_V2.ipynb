    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The study of nuclear matter is vital in gaining a better understanding of our universe as it pushes the frontier of our knowledge. Many phenomena encountered in nuclear physics is paramount to other fields of research such as condense matter and atomic physics due to the implicit dependence on structure and unique many body systems. One can pursue this endeavor by looking at lifetime measurements of excited states of nucleons, protons/neutrons, as they decay to lower energy states, nuclear dynamics of nuclei in fixed target experiments, and/or contributions to spin of nuclei from the microcosm within the nucleon consisting of quarks and gluons. The completion of FRIB at Michigan State University (MSU) will not only enhance MSU's reputation for having the #1 nuclear physics graduate program in the world, but will also plunge the nuclear physics community into a new era of discovery as FRIB will provide a myriad of new isotopes to discover. As the FRIB Wikipedia states, \"FRIB will enable scientists to make discoveries about the properties of rare isotopes in order to better understand the physics of nuclei, nuclear astrophysics, fundamental interactions, and applications for society, including in medicine, homeland security and industry.\" With this new facility being built on campus, MSU will continue the drive of discovery for the sake of enlightnment and application. \n",
    "\n",
    "Completion of FRIB in 2022 (as was the goal before COVID-19) will require a tremendous amount of analysis and simulation to get optimal use of this facility, as it will provide enhanced yields and transmission of fragments collected in a spectrometer. The predicted values of transmission and yields for particular isotopes are perfromed with a program called \"LISE++\" that is shared among several facilities such as NSCL, GANIL, RIKEN, and GSI, the cyclotron institue at Texas A&M, and eventually FRIB. LISE++ comes with powerful Monte Carlo simulations for fragment transmissions, fission fragment kinematics, and ion optics and optimization that allows it to successfully predict values for transmission and yield based on detector configuration input. As powerful as LISE++ is, it becomes tedious if on is looking to explore various exotic nuclei at once as it requires a tremendous amount of interaction with the LISE++ GUI. In this particular project, I aim to reduce the amount of interaction with the GUI by automating part of the process required to retrieve yield and transmission values from LISE++. "

The language this will be done in is python due to the several automation libraries that can be used in conjuction with each other to achieve this goal. Modules such as pyautogui, pyperclip, pandas, and numpy will be used in parallel to successfully ease the amount of interaction with the GUI, as human interaction can lead to mistakes. \n",
